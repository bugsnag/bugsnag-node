Bugsnag Notifier for Node.js
============================

The Bugsnag Notifier for Node.js automatically notifies you of synchronous and asynchronous errors in your Node.js applications.

[Bugsnag](http://bugsnag.com) captures errors in real-time from your web, mobile and desktop applications, helping you to understand and resolve them as fast as possible. [Create a free account](http://bugsnag.com) to start capturing errors from your applications.


Installation & Setup
--------------------

Install bugsnag using npm:

```bash
npm install bugsnag --save
```

Require bugsnag in your node.js app:

```javascript
var bugsnag = require("bugsnag");
```

Register the bugsnag notifier with your API key:

```javascript
bugsnag.register("your-api-key-here");
```

See below for [additional configuration options](#configuration).


Using Express or Connect Middleware
-----------------------------------

If your app uses [Express](http://expressjs.com/) or [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/), Bugsnag can automatically capture errors that happen during requests, including errors that happen in asynchronous code.

To ensure that asynchronous errors are routed to the error handler, add the `requestHandler` middleware to your app as the **first middleware**:

```javascript
app.use(bugsnag.requestHandler);
```

You'll also need to add Bugsnag's error handling middleware, make sure to add this after all other middleware, but before any "error" middleware:

```javascript
app.use(bugsnag.errorHandler);
```


Using Coffeescript
------------------

When executing coffeecript code directly using the `coffee` executable, Bugsnag cannot notify about uncaught exceptions that occur at the top level of your app. This is due to a ["feature"](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/1438) of the `coffee` executable.

To avoid this issue, make sure to compile your coffeescript files into javascript before running your app.


Send Non-Fatal Exceptions to Bugsnag
------------------------------------

To send non-fatal exceptions to Bugsnag, you can pass any `Error` object or string to the `notify` method:

```javascript
bugsnag.notify(new Error("Non-fatal"));
```

You can also send additional meta data with your exception:

```javascript
bugsnag.notify(new Error("Non-fatal"), {
  user: {
    username: "bob-hoskins",
    name: "Bob Hoskins",
    email: "bob@example.com"
  }
});
```

See the full documentation for the [notify](#notify) function for more details.


Capturing Asynchronous Errors
-----------------------------

Bugsnag can automatically capture both synchronous and asynchronous errors in your code if you wrap it in an `autoNotify` function. *Note: If you are using the `bugsnag.requestHandler` middleware for Express or Connect, we automatically wrap your requests with `autoNotify`.*

```javascript
bugsnag.autoNotify(function() {
  // Your code here
});
```

Additionally, you can pass options into `autoNotify` that will be used as default options for the notify call to any errors. See the [notify](#notify) docs for more details.

```javascript
bugsnag.autoNotify({ context: "thisContext" }, function() {
  // Your code here
});
```

The `autoNotify` function creates a Node.js [`Domain`](http://nodejs.org/api/domain.html) which automatically routes all uncaught errors to Bugsnag.


Capturing Errors in Callback Functions
--------------------------------------

Many callback functions in Node are called with an error as the first arguement. Bugsnag can intercept these errors if you wrap your callback with  `bugsnag.intercept`:

```javascript
functionWithCallback(bugsnag.intercept(function(argument) {
  // Your code here
}));
```

If the first argument is non-null, Bugsnag will be automatically notified of the error, and your callback will not be executed. The first argument is never passed to your callback, since it is assumed to be the error argument.


Configuration
-------------

The `bugsnag.register` can accept an options object as its second parameter. The options can be a combination of any of the following:

### releaseStage

By default, Bugsnag looks at the NODE_ENV environment variable to see what releaseStage the script is running in. If that is not set, Bugsnag assumes you are running in production. If you want to override this behavior, you can set the `releaseStage` option:

```javascript
bugsnag.register("your-api-key-here", { releaseStage: "development" });
```

### notifyReleaseStages

By default the notifier will notify Bugsnag of production and development exceptions. If you wish to be notified about production exceptions only, you can set the `notifyReleaseStages` option.

```javascript
bugsnag.register("your-api-key-here", { notifyReleaseStages: ["production"] });
```

### appVersion

The Bugsnag notifier will automatically use the version from your `package.json` file. If you want to override this behavior, you can set the `appVersion` option:

```javascript
bugsnag.register("your-api-key-here", { appVersion: "1.0.0" });
```

### autoNotifyUncaught

Bugsnag will automatically register for the `uncaughtexception` event. If you do not wish for this to happen, you can disable the functionality as part of the register call:

```javascript
bugsnag.register("your-api-key-here", { autoNotifyUncaught: false });
```

### projectRoot

Bugsnag can highlight stacktrace lines that are in your project, and automatically hides stacktrace lines from external libraries. If Bugsnag is not hiding external stacktrace lines, it is likely that the `projectRoot` is being incorrectly calculated. You can set `projectRoot` as part of the register call:

```javascript
bugsnag.register("your-api-key-here", { projectRoot: "/path/to/root" });
```

### packageJSON

If the Bugsnag notifier is unable to locate your `package.json`, you can specify where to find it using `packageJSON`:

```javascript
bugsnag.register("your-api-key-here", { packageJSON: "/path/to/package.json" });
```

### useSSL

By default, errors will be sent to Bugsnag using SSL. To disable SSL, you can set `useSSL`:

```javascript
bugsnag.register("your-api-key-here", { useSSL: false });
```

### metaData

It is often very useful to send some extra application or user specific data along with every exception. To do this, you can set the `metaData`:
    
```javascript
bugsnag.register("your-api-key-here", { metaData: {
  user: {
    username: "bob-hoskins",
    name: "Bob Hoskins",
    email: "bob@example.com"
  }
}});
```

You can adjust this after calling register by using the `bugsnag.metaData` property.

Notify
------

The `bugsnag.notify` function accepts an error as either a string or an Error object as the first argument, as well as options object as its second parameter. The options can be a combination of any of the following:

### errorName

Errors in your Bugsnag dashboard are grouped by their "error class", to override the error class you can set `errorName`:

```javascript
bugsnag.notify(new Error("Something went badly wrong"), { errorName: "BadError" });
```

### context

A string representing what was happening in your application at the time of the error. In Express/Connect apps, this will automatically be set to the URL of the current request.

```javascript
bugsnag.notify(new Error("Something went badly wrong"), { context: "/users/new" });
```

### userId

A unique identifier for a user affected by this error. This could be any distinct identifier that makes sense for your application. In Express/Connect apps, this is automatically set to the ip address of the current request.

```javascript
bugsnag.notify(new Error("Something went badly wrong"), { userId: "bob-hoskins" });
```

### metaData

Any extra data you want along with the exception report to Bugsnag. To do this just set other properties on the object, and you will see them as tabs in the error dashboard.

```javascript
bugsnag.notify(new Error("Something went badly wrong"), {
  user: {
    username: "bob-hoskins",
    name: "Bob Hoskins",
    email: "bob@example.com"
  }
});
```

### callback

A callback to call after notifying Bugsnag of an error. The callback has two arguments, `err` and `response`. The `err` argument will contain any error received when trying to send the notification, the `response` object will contain the response received from Bugsnag:

```javascript
bugsnag.notify(new Error("Something went badly wrong"), function (error, response) {
  if(err) {
    // Something went wrong
  } else {
    // The notify worked
  }
})
```
